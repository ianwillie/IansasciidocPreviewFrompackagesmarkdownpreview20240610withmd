# Iansasciidoc Previewfrompackagesmarkdownpreview20240610withmd package

Ians adaption of markdown-preview to preview asciidoc files. Additionally it will preview additional flavours of markdown by identifying them with a simple code in the front matter of the file being edited.

**Be sure to disable** atom-language-asciidoctor which is an atom package. It does some strange things, for example, if it is enabled may package will no longer open files with extensions: .txt, .adoc and possibly others occassionally like .ron.
Others Atom packages for AsciiDoc should not be enables including: language-asciidoc,: Syntax highlighting and snippets for AsciiDoc & autocomplete-asciidoc. asciidoc-preview: Show a preview for the AsciiDoc has been fixed and should be OK but it is hoped that the current pacakage will replace that and be more resillient to changes in pulsar and its dependencies.
asciidoc-image-helper: When pasting an image into an Asciidoc document, this package will paste clipboard image data as a file into a folder specified by the user.
asciidoc-assistant: install Atom AsciiDoc basic packages with one package.

Add this to config.cson under core. It ensures that adoc & asciidoc files are treated as text not as YAML type files:
core:

```
  customFileTypes:
    "text.plain": [
      "adoc"
      "asciidoc"
    ]
```

## What does work

```ctrl-alt-shft-c``` will preview adoc type file   
```ctrl-alt-shft-g``` (cursor in adoc source pane) will render the file in external falkon browser.
```ctrl-alt-shft-s``` will save files as pdf and preview and render this file in pulsar..
```ctrl-shft-s``` will save as html and show this source file in pulsar. Using node asciidoctor-web-pdf.js. (Also tried to run
asciidoctor-pdf.rb but this fails wi no output.

## Previewing markdown files.
  With cursor in an ordinary md file ```ctrl-alt-shft-c``` will preview as original pulsar markdown-preview github flavour.

   If a single one of the codes exactly listed below is placed on a single line then ```ctrl-alt-shft-c``` will run pandoc for that md flavour.

   ``` ::choosePandocMdFlavour:markdown: (Pandoc version) ```  
   ``` ::choosePandocMdFlavour:markdown_strict:``` (Pandoc version less extensions for Gruber's original, Markdown.pl)
   ``` ::choosePandocMdFlavour:markdown_phpextra: ``` (PHP Markdown Extra)  
   ``` ::choosePandocMdFlavour:markdown_mmd: ``` (MultiMarkdown)   
   ``` ::choosePandocMdFlavour:commonmark: ``` (CommonMark)  
   ``` ::choosePandocMdFlavour:commonmark_x: ```  (CommonMark with many pandoc extensions)
   ``` ::choosePandocMdFlavour:gfm: ``` (Github-Flavored Markdown)
   ``` ::choosePandocMdFlavour:markdown_github: ``` (deprecated GitHub-Flavored Markdown)

#### Previewing Rmarkdown files.
Rmardown is the only markdown that I have used when analysing data using the R app. Rmarkdown is Pandoc's version of markdown extended to include the requirements of R and knitr. For detailed information see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40563479/relationship-between-r-markdown-knitr-pandoc-and-bookdown How well this app will render Rmarkdown I have never tried.


## What does not work
Infront matter :backend:  is unlikely to work cost backends are written in ruby & js versions needed.

# README.md for original markdown-preview

Show the rendered HTML markdown to the right of the current editor using <kbd>ctrl-shift-m</kbd>.

It is currently enabled for `.markdown`, `.md`, `.mdown`, `.mkd`, `.mkdown`, `.ron`, and `.txt` files.

## Customize

By default Iansasciidoc Previewfrompackagesmarkdownpreview20240610withmd uses the colors of the active syntax theme. Enable **Use GitHub.com Style** in the __package settings__ to make it look closer to how markdown files get rendered on github.com.

![iansasciidoc-previewfrompackagesmarkdownpreview20240610withmd GitHub style](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/378023/10013087/24ccc7ec-6149-11e5-97ea-53a842a715ea.png)

When **Use GitHub.com Style** is selected, you can further customize the theme of the Markdown preview with the **GitHub.com Style Mode** setting. Since the GitHub website has a light theme and a dark theme, `iansasciidoc-previewfrompackagesmarkdownpreview20240610withmd` allows you to choose which theme to use when previewing your files. By default, it will use whatever mode is preferred by your system, but you can opt into “Light” or “Dark” to force it to use a particular theme.

No matter which theme you use, you can apply further customizations in your `styles.less` file. For example:

```css
.iansasciidoc-previewfrompackagesmarkdownpreview20240610withmd prec {
  background-color: #444;
}
```

## Language identifiers in fenced code blocks

A detailed Markdown specification helps to ensure that Markdown is displayed consistently across multiple parsers. Sadly, the same isn’t true of code block language identifiers — the strings you use to tell the renderer what sort of code is inside a code block.

The CommonMark specification [explicitly avoids standardizing these identifiers](https://spec.commonmark.org/0.31.2/#info-string):

> The first word of the info string is typically used to specify the language of the code sample, and rendered in the class attribute of the code tag. However, this spec does not mandate any particular treatment of the info string.

There are several valid ways to infer specific languages from language identifiers such as `js`, `less`, `coffee`,  and `c`. This package supports the following systems, configured via the **Syntax Highlighting Language Identifiers** setting:

  * [Linguist](https://github.com/github-linguist/linguist): Used by GitHub (previously the default and only language identification system).
  * [Chroma](https://github.com/alecthomas/chroma): Used by CodeBerg/Gitea/Hugo/Goldmark.
  * [Rouge](https://github.com/rouge-ruby/rouge): Used by GitLab/Jekyll.
  * [HighlightJS](https://highlightjs.org/): Used in a number of places, but most relevantly on the [Pulsar Package Registry](https://web.pulsar-edit.dev/) website.

If none of these systems meets your needs, you may specify custom language identifiers. This may not be as portable as the systems described above, but it will at least produce the desired outcome on your own system.

The setting **Custom Syntax Highlighting Language Identifiers** lets you define a list of custom language identifiers that match up to languages available within your Pulsar installation.

For example, if you wanted to map `j` to JavaScript and `p` to Python, you’d add the following text to the **Custom Syntax Highlighting Language Identifiers** field:

```
j: source.js, p: source.python
```

Now `iansasciidoc-previewfrompackagesmarkdownpreview20240610withmd` will understand what to do with fenced code blocks that begin with <code>\`\`\`j</code> or <code>\`\`\`p</code>. These custom identifiers will work alongside whatever system you’ve chosen with **Syntax Highlighting Language Identifiers**, but will supersede that system in the event of conflict.
